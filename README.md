# Table Leg

Simple starter template for a Google Spreadsheets-driven project using [Tabletop.js](https://github.com/jsoma/tabletop) I made to save time getting started on similar projects after creating [this project for Timeline](http://longhotsummer.timeline.com). 

Has a basic page set up with Tabletop.js and wired to [this Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12Gtjc00RaSKo7cYYiYks9yxL7ptwnThH9EYzOvOpVgs/pubhtml), outputting that data using Handlebars.
